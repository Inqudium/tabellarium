## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial public release of the `KafkaAppender`: resilient Logback
  appender shipping structured log events to Apache Kafka.
- Per-topic-class circuit breakers (Resilience4j) with half-open
  throttling.
- Mandatory override policy for compliance-graded topic classes
  (AUDIT, FUNCTIONAL, TECHNICAL, PERFORMANCE).
- Asynchronous fallback appender dispatch via `FallbackDispatcher`.
- Message enrichment with `meta.*` headers and MDC-`traceId`
  partitioning key.
- Opt-in Micrometer metrics with Spring binding helper
  (`KafkaAppenderMetricsBinding`).
- Per-class `client.id` default (`tabellarium-<component>-<topicclass>`)
  so producers are attributable on the broker; an operator-supplied
  `client.id` wins.
- Self-logging guard: events from the appender's own Kafka producer
  network threads are ignored, preventing producer-log feedback loops.
- Eager validation of idempotence-incompatible producer tuning
  (`retries=0`, `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection>5`) with a
  clear startup error naming the conflict.
- Full Kafka topic-name validation at startup: reserved names (`.`,
  `..`) and names over 249 characters are rejected eagerly.
- `meta.agent.version` header is derived from the build (Maven-filtered
  resource) instead of a hardcoded constant.

### Fixed

- Self-logging guard matches the exact producer network-thread naming
  scheme instead of a substring, so an operator-supplied short
  `client.id` can no longer silently swallow events from unrelated
  application threads.
- `stop()` deregisters all Micrometer meters, closes the per-producer
  `KafkaClientMetrics` binders, and removes the appender's
  circuit-breaker meters; repeated binds replace instead of duplicate.
- `KafkaAppender.stop()` and `FallbackDispatcher.close()` are
  idempotent; remaining queued events are counted as dropped exactly
  once and the queue is drained.
- `HalfOpenThrottle` anchors its "no probe yet" state to the actual
  monotonic clock, removing a theoretical permanent-denial mode on
  platforms with a deeply negative `nanoTime` origin.
- Appender discovery in `KafkaAppenderMetricsBinding` is cycle-safe.
- `kafka.appender.events.fallback` is documented as "diverted from
  Kafka" (counted also when no fallback is configured and the event is
  dropped).
- Configuration guide, metrics overview, and Grafana dashboards under
  `docs/config/` and `docs/metrics/`.
